# EAT POOP YOU CAT

## About

This is an online implementation of the pencil-and-paper game Eat Poop You Cat (described nicely [over here](https://steemit.com/gaming/@danmaruschak/an-illustrated-guide-to-playing-the-folk-pencil-and-paper-drawing-game-eat-poop-you-cat)). The game runs on a Discord or Slack channel. A bot manages the game, sends links to players at the appropriate times, and has a web interface for viewing games, and playing your turn.

The completed games are viewable here: https://epyc.phlegmatic.ca/
